미안해 오늘 섹시하게 화장이 잘 됐네

미안해 내 방안이 좀 지저분하지

과거는 뒤로하고 jump out

이 순간만큼은 난 살아있어

나를 사랑하는 그녀가 불행해 보여
자취를 감추네 대중들이 두려워
많은 동경과 환호 정서불안
죽음에 대해 고뇌해 괴로운 밤

내 젊음의 유품은 사진뿐
내 청춘은 남들의 장식품
영적인 기를 받는 내 감성
네가 보지 못한 미래 난 봤어

내 인생 멜로디는 내가 지휘해
고조되는 climax 를 즐기네
내게 미친 소녀들은 똑똑해
자격지심 너를 가지고 놀기에

한 여자로는 만족
못 하는 bad boy but I'm nice
안 넘어가고는 못 배길걸
Let me blow ya mind

언제부터였는지
감흥이 없어진 우리
이젠 마치 진 빠진
김 빠진 콜라같지
무감각해진 첫 느낌
서로를 향한 곁눈질
그깟 사랑에 난 목매지 않아
Don't wanna try no more

마지막 그 순간에 머문 시간
너에겐 그저 지난날이지만

Baby, there's no, no, no, no more tomorrow
(Till you come back, everyday is yesterday)
Baby, there's no, no, no, no more tomorrow

가슴을 찢던 그 기억이 달력을 찢고 한해처럼 저물어가
너를 잊고 사는 척 하기도 해
아직도 내 세상은 변함없어 너만 없어
사람들은 다 돌아보면 웃게 되는 거래
너를 향했던 고개를 틀기도 힘든 내게
듣기도 싫은데 왜 떠들까? 난 여기서 머문다

하지마라 내일은 해가 뜬다는 말
너와의 밤보다 캄캄한 아침일 테니

잠 못 드는 밤에도 베개의 반가운 품
나를 꿈꾸게 했던 갈채는 지난날이지만
손뼉 치는 딸을 보며 취한다, 이제 난
모든 걸 잃었다고 하기엔
99를 놓쳐도 사소한 1에
크게 감동하기에 난 웃고 있어
내겐 죽고 싶어란 말? No. Let it be
나를 숨 쉬게 하는 건 잔잔한 비
친구와의 달콤한 시간낭비 (Uh huh)
붉은 꽃, 푸른 꽃, 새벽의 구름 꽃
사랑이란 정원에 흐드러지는 웃음 꽃. Bloom
내 맘의 휴식
제주도의 바람, 서울 밤의 불빛
거릴 걷다보면 들려오는 에픽하이의 music
내 아내와 아이의 눈빛

이젠 그만 아파도 될까? (Get, get up now)
그만 두려워도 될까? (Get, get up now)
눈물 흘린 만큼만 웃어 봐도 될까?
Get up and stand up

곤란한 안녕이란 말도 나 몰라 라
또 올라나 하듯이 기다리는 건 내 목을 졸라 막
내 눈에 아른거리는 너 그런 날 두고 가버리는 너

그대도 눈물 흘리고 있다면
단 한번 내 생각 한적 있다면
지금 달려와 날 안아줄래요

눈을 감아도 그대 얼굴 생각이 나서
숨을 쉬고 있어도 계속 숨이 막혀서
우리 첫 만남은 오직 상처만 남은
슬픈 영혼 같은걸
나의 마지막 말을 꼭 행복하라는
바보 같은 말들 뿐인걸

날 사랑해줘요 다시 내게 와줘요
예전처럼 다시 날 안아줘요
날 위로해줘요 지금 전화해줘요
예전처럼 그대 목소리 듣고싶네요

널 잊을거라고 goodbye 약속했지만

내게 편한 나의 경계선이어서
심장만 어지럽혀 치워둔
쓸모없는 감정은 먼지 덮여

여길 벗어나면 죽음
익숙한 슬픔보다 낯선 행복이 더 싫어서
걸음 버린 나 헌신발이 될까만 겁이나
세상, 세월, 사람 날 꺾어 신어서
잊고 있어
문 앞에 수북이 쌓인 신문과 고지서처럼
나와 상관없는 세상의 생각
요구들 내 앞에 늘어놓지 마
This is my home, leave me alone
여기만은 들어오지 마

이젠 눈물 없이도 운다
그저 숨 쉬듯이 또 운다
집이 되어버린 슬픔을
