Ridin' on a midnight bus bound for Mexico
One was headed for vacation, one for higher education
And two of them were searchin' for lost souls
That driver never ever saw the stop sign
An' eighteen wheelers can't stop on a dime

There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, Heaven only knows
I guess it's not what you take when you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go

Well it wasn't two weeks

Wanda started getting abused
She put on dark glasses and long sleeved blouses
And make-up to cover a bruise
Well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce
She let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order
And put her in intensive care

Right away Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta

Sink or swim you gotta give it a whirl

Life's a dance you learn as you go
Sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow
Don't worry about what you don't know
Life's a dance you learn as you go

We both started laughin' when the sky started to rain

Get along, on down the road
We've got a long, long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along

And that t-shirt on, dead man tell no tales

You've ever been and we'll write your name on a dollar bill

You got my number you can call on me
If you're in trouble put the fall on me

When it don't add up you can count on me

Settle in, let it out

Give me a six-string flat-top guitar,
Put all you hillbillies in a honky tonk bar.
Show me to the stage an' set me free.

I never was a roughneck pumpin' crude down the line.

I stopped for just a minute, to see a friend outside of town
Put my collar up, I found his name, and felt the wind die down

And a drunk man in a cowboy hat took me by surprise
Wearing shiny boots, a Nudi suit, and haunting haunted eyes
He said friend it's good to see you, it's nice to know you care

If you think you can do better than this

In the summertime when I was young I was there everyday and weekend
Flirtin' with the girls that lived down the street
Leanin' in close, I can feel her heartbeat
Her heartbeat

Summer love
In the bed of a truck
With the cab lights glowing like a spotlight on both of us
In a field full of grass
Lightning bugs lighting up the night light
A chandelier in her eyes
Really don't like how the time flies by us
I'm missin' the taste of
Summer love

When the sky gets too dark
When the water gets too deep
When I feed the fire so much that I can't even take the heat
If I ever run too far
And when the pieces come unglued
The mess of me will always need the best of you

Through all the highs and lows
The can't undo's I regret the most
The wall so hard feels like I can't get through
Rescue
Every morning by your side
Just one look at you sometimes
You don't even know you're coming to
The rescue

She was planning a welcome home barbeque
Green bean casserole, Grandma's recipe
There was a knock on the door 'round two o'clock
Two uniforms and her heart stopped
Yellow ribbon 'round an oak tree
Blowin' in the breeze

Here's to the ones that didn't make it back home
The ones we ain't seen in so long
The hold up a beer ones, the wish they were here ones
The not forgotten but gone
They're in a better place up there
But they sure left a hole down here
We just go on livin' and go on missin' the ones

Lay off in the tall grass, so my view is the stars

From all the thunder and lightning so I feel a spark

Hoping that the county sheriff don't stop me

Sweet tea full in my solo cup

Smoking on some grown where the cattle graze

It was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a one room, rundown shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans

We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least we were hard pressed
Then mama spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancin' dress

Well, Mama washed and combed
And curled my hair
And she painted my eyes and lips
Then I stepped into a satin dancin' dress
That had a split on the side clean up to my hip
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good
Standin' back from the lookin' glass
There stood a woman where a half grown kid had stood

She said ""Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down""
She said ""Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down""

Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck
Then she kissed my cheek
And then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes
As she started to speak
She looked at our pitiful shack
And then she looked at me
And took a ragged breath
She said ""Your pa's runned off and I'm real sick

Who are praying they'll get outta here alive
The loud mouth in the corner's gettin' to me
Talking 'bout my earrings and my hair
I guess he ain't read the signs that say I been to prison
Someone ought to warn him 'fore I knock him off his chair

Cause my longhair just can't cover up my red neck
I've won every fight I've ever fought
Hey I don't need some turkey telling me that I ain't country
And sayin' I ain't worth the damned ol' ticket that he bought

Might as well share, might as well smile

It'll grow up in a little bitty town
A big yellow bus and little bitty books

Didn't know what he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic

I wish it wasn't 4 AM standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

Sometimes in the middle of the night
I can feel you again
But I just miss you
And I just wish you were a better man

And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you
And I just wish you were a better man
A better man

I know I'm probably better off all alone
Than needing a man
Who could change his mind at any given minute
And it's always on your terms

Was a six string
Took him with me
Everywhere I'd go

Found a drummer and made the road my home

Ooh I wouldn't change a thing
It made the man I am today
My roots
Always keep me grounded
Roots
Remind me where I'm from
Even when Im a thousand miles away from my roots
I'm home

Every Friday
You can find me
At dixie tavern
Playing with my band
We start the show with a round a whiskey
We played our hearts out and wished it never end

Ooh I wouldn't change a thing
It made the man I am today

A piece of my childhood, will never be forgoten

It was, just an old plywood boat
A '75 Johnson with electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
He'd say, You can't beat the way an old wood boat rides

Just a little lake across the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When daddy let me
Drive

Just an old half-ton shortbed Ford
My uncle bought new, in '64
Daddy got it right, 'cause the engine was smoking

Feels like magic only
I'm right where I wanna be

Everybody's talkin' about heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven

Cattails dancing in the light

We may lie down in darkness
But we don't lose our sparks; we bring back a good story to tell
Cause we grew up around beauty

We knew it was our appointed duty to love like the world might end
And to toast to good nights with friends

On a hot summer night
He wrote ""Billy Bob loves Charlene""

Raising sweet corn, kids, and tomatoes
They went together like a hand and a glove

Katy did sing like a symphony
Porch swing swayin' like a Tennessee lullaby
Melody blowin' through the willow tree

What was I supposed to do
Standin' there lookin' at you
A lonely boy far from home
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you, maybe it was me
But it sure felt right

Read about you in a Faulkner novel
Met you once in a William's play
Heard about you in a country love song
Summer nights beauty took my breath away

Ninety miles an hour down a lover's lane

Oh, if she could have only seen
That fate's got cards that it don't want to show and

That boy's just a Walkaway Joe
Born to be a leaver
Tell you from the word ""go""
Destined to deceive her

He's the wrong kind of paradise
She's gonna know it in a matter of time
