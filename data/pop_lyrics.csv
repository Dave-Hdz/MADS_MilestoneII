To say F you

What's the point in saying that when
You know how I'll react?
You think you can just take it
Back, but shit just don't work like that

You're the drug that I'm addicted to
And I want you so bad
Guess I'm stuck with you

When it don't work out for the better
If it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down, when it all falls down

Big ups, my nigga, we up, my nigga
You pussy ass nigga, man, fuck y'all niggas
'Cause I'm that nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga

I woke up in Chris Brown's body (oh yeah)
Somehow this shit turned into Freaky Friday
But we got no choice but to turn this bitch sideways

Why we had to waste so much time
Well, we just pick up, pick up and start again

Time is a bastard, I won't break my neck to get around it
But aren't we so brave to give up a fight
And let the years go by without us?

Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By 11 smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was 11 years old, my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was 11 years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about the glory, just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was 20 years old

Bitches dancin' naked in my livin' room
She straight out of college, just turned 22
Girl, get your money up, I ain't even mad at you
Got you all on me, makin' these niggas catchin' attitudes
Tell 'em don't start it, my niggas retarded
Fuck the judge and the sentence, huh, I got a good lawyer
I got a few girls on the way, baby girl, you ain't leavin'
It's my birthday with the cake, fuck it up, then let me eat it

Pull up on your bitch, tell your man I'm sorry

Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills

But shit, it was ninety-nine cents!
Bag it, copping it, washing it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passing up on those moccasins someone else been has walking in

'Til you get lonely, sure I get lonely, sometimes

All my friends are wasted
And I hate this club

Another Friday night I wasted
My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to you babe

My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods

She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said ""Nah, I was the same without it""

Scared of the feds, had to switch up my cellular

With the air, like I don't care, baby by the way

Huh (Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do

Here come bad news talking this and that (Yeah)
Well give me all you got, don't hold back (Yeah)
Well I should probably warn you I'll be just fine (Yeah)
No offence to you don't waste your time
Here's why

Saying, ""How the hell did this shit happen
Oh baby

We be all night

Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding up in that club
Drunk in love

We be all night, love, love

We be all night, and everything alright
No complaints from my body

Wanna piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride

I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave
Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?
I heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave
And the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name
So when I leave here on this earth, did I take more than I gave?
Did I look out for the people or did I do it all for fame?
Legend it's exodus searching for euphoria
Trudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us
Got 20, 000 deep off in the street like we some warriors
My mama told me never bow your head, woo!

I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this

Don't judge me, won't you tell a friend y'all gon' see

Order Domino's and she take off all her clothes
Nigga you know how it goes, make the pizza man wait
The best kept secret
Even hoes try and keep it and I leak the damn tape
Rest in peace any nigga want beef
Even secret service couldn't keep the man safe

I said to the window, to the wall
My nigga ride when I call
Got bitches all in my mind
Fuck nigga blocking my shine

I know just who you wan' be

You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we'll make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me myself I got nothing to prove

You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been working at a convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?

Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothin'
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

Watchu mean, watchu say, watchu mean what I say?
Doublin' up your worth, whatchu want from the boy?
Runnin' to get the ring and I told all my boys
So, pick up the aunties, pick up the nieces
Call all of your nephews, hit up Martika
Tell her that I can't come around no mo'
When the sun don't shine round the year no more
Northside hitter ain't in the north no more
And I ain't going back to being broke no more, ah
Real shit, I'mma keep with the boys
I'mma keep words soft
Fuck it homie, roll dat dope shit
Baby let me, then I grow shit
Glowed up, got me fitted like a glow stick
Uh, but that's okay cause I dance through the pain

I saw you in the party soft lips soft spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is than tell me if I'm wrong or right if
I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up In a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for a while
He said Peter Pan that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely
And ever since that day

I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the Woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

Run run Lost Boy, they say to me
Away from all of reality
Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free

I ain't no average bitch
Baby come swing my way
I'ma put you on this game
Get it all gas no breaks (skrrt)

Just for you I might jeopardize
My whole life I might sacrifice
Way you look is like woah (woah)
Got me locked and I'm hypnotized
Shakira-like and these hips don't lie
Say I don't but I always try
Way you look is like woah
Got me locked and I'm hypnotized

You, you got so much potential
Every moment spent with you
I bet was always eventful
I've never seen your type of species
Give me heebiejeebies
Attitude Khaleesi
Woah, and I'm like woah, woah, woah

Don't you know you're something else?

Sensitive tough, don't get enough
I've been drowning in you, lost in the rush
Faded, you stuck? I'll help you up

I don't care to get too loud
Sexy, I want you now
Bet I can take you there
Whispering in your ear
What do you wanna feel?
Let's just enjoy the thrill
I'll take over the wheel
I'll give you the touch you're missing

Get Low, Get Low
Hands on your waist, let's go
Get Low, Get Low
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb
Get Low, Get Low
Hands on your waist, let's go
Get Low, Get Low
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb

As beautiful as you are, I want to light up your dark
Maybe you don't believe in me
It's hard to know what you see in me
Don't be quick to say no
My chest is your pillow
Come out of the shadows
I know that you're fragile, yeah

I figured it out from black and white
Seconds and hours
Maybe they had to take some time

I know how it goes
I know how it goes from wrong and right
Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other tight like us?
Did they ever fight like us?

You and I, we don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between you and I

I can't believe that she's mine
