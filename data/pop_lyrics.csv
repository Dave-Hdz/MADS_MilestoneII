To say F you

What's the point in saying that when
You know how I'll react?
You think you can just take it
Back, but shit just don't work like that

You're the drug that I'm addicted to
And I want you so bad
Guess I'm stuck with you

When it don't work out for the better
If it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down, when it all falls down

All of my own words are all over written on the signs

It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no

Easy baby maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love

Why we had to waste so much time
Well, we just pick up, pick up and start again

Time is a bastard, I won't break my neck to get around it
But aren't we so brave to give up a fight
And let the years go by without us?

Are you somewhere feeling lonely

Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?

I remember the make-up running down your face

You the nigga
You're the one that be talkin' to the popos
Porsche sittin' on Forgis
Niggas can't afford these

The Panamera shittin' on the 9-11
I call my homies, not 911
I'm that nigga with the juice
But I'll never do my nigga like Pac did Q

Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?

I got a shorty name Texas Syn
She got a buddy named Young JB and now you know the deal

I gave away my money and now we don't even speak
I drove miles and miles, but would you do the same for me?
Oh, honestly?
Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song
It goes on and on

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
My farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain

Nah, I'm just pumped, bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
People like ""Damn, that's a cold ass honky!""
Rolling in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink except my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standing next to me
Probably shoulda washed this, smells like R. Kelly's sheets (Pisssssss)
But shit, it was ninety-nine cents!
Bag it, copping it, washing it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passing up on those moccasins someone else been has walking in
Bummy and grudgy, fucking it, I am stunting and flossing and
Saving my money and I'm hella happy, that's a bargain bitch

No for real, ask your grandpa

Somewhere I lost a piece of me
Smoking cigarettes on balconies

Need you on the other side

So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you

My mama told me: ""Boy, make a decision!""

Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision

They sendin' all my homies on a mission
And I ain't tryna miss out on these millions

I jumped up out the Wraith, Kodak bought a Wraith
I get any girl I want, any girl I want
She want me to save the day, but I ain't got a cape

And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot

Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a ménage à trois

Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky

I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves

I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you

I've looked for love in every stranger

Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on

Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town

Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was 14, with the four-track bussin'
Halfway cross that city with the back, pack, fat, cat, crushin'

Love grows colder in the winter

Promise that you'll keep my love with ya

Hands up and touch the sky
Can't stop 'cause we're so high
Let's do this one more time, oh

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky

No, not today

I got your number
'Cause you're a joker
And I'm a courtside killer queen
And you will kiss the ring

So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' outcho mouth

Pullin' back the curtain by myself, take a look, ayy

I'm a bar spitta, I'm a hard hitta
Yeah, I'm light-skinned, but I'm still a dark nigga
I'm a wig splitta, I'm a tall figure
I'm a unforgivin' wild-ass dog, nigga

I was thinkin' 'bout the fans
We were underground
Loadin' merch in that twelve-passenger van
In a small club in Minnesota
And the snow outside of 1st Ave
I just wanted my name in a star
Now look at where we at

Still growin' up (Woo, ooh), still growin' up (Woo, ooh)
I would lay in my bed and dream about what I'd become (Woo, ooh)
Couldn't wait to get older (Woo, ooh), couldn't wait to be some (Woo, ooh)
Now that I'm here, wishing I was still young
Those good old days

I wish somebody would have told me, babe
That someday, these will be the good old days

Drop-topping, playing our favorite CD's

I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up In a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

She fuck with small town niggas I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas I got bigger dreams (listen)
She fuck with small town niggas I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas I got bigger dreams (listen)

Way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away

Feel my blood runnin'
Swear the sky's fallin'

Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try

No where to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the moon
And even sometimes he would go away too
Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for a while
He said Peter Pan that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely
And ever since that day

I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the Woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

Run run Lost Boy, they say to me
Away from all of reality
Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free
Neverland is home to lost boys like me

You and I, we don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between you and I

At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't
Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
To understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it, oh

So won't you send me your location

My God, you're beautiful
It's like the first time when we open the door
Before we got used to usual

It might seem superficial, stereotypical, man
You dress up just a little and I'm like, ""Ohhh, damn""

So suddenly I'm in love with a stranger
I can't believe that she's mine
Now all I see is you with fresh eyes, fresh eyes
So suddenly I'm in love with a stranger
I can't believe that she's mine, yeah
And now all I see is you with fresh eyes, fresh eyes

Scared of what I might say, cause I'm at the edge

And our eyes are crossing paths across the room
There's only one thing left for us to do

You can touch me with slow hands
Speed it up, baby, make me sweat
Dreamland, take me there cause I want your sex
If my body had a say, I wouldn't turn away
Touch, make love, taste you
If my body told the truth, baby I would do

If I had it my way, I would take the lead
And if I had it my way, I would take you deep
If my body had a say, I'd get it off my chest
