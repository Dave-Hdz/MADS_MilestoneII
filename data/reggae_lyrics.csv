And all dem big plays, no paydays, and now them sell out Jah Jah prophet them for rice and peas
I man say forgive, but never forget. To spill my blood that a dem intent
In wolf Eyes, is bare lies, and now I penetrate them through how they disguise

Bare chains on backbones, and now them wash our brains with charcoals
With stress, you're helpless, Until them turn your soul case into a basket
Well Babylonian, you time's numbered. I know tomorrow is Holy Ethiopia
That's when the Lion from Zion; HIM a go bust the seven seals and free up I man

Slave trade Abolishment, A Hollywood Illusion made with Intent

Can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe

I bet you think I'm supposed to smile, put the best outside
Put on an act to protect my pride
You want me to take it like a man, but I'm a girl who cries
So if I puncture your tires, don't be too surprised

And while I'm at it, hell, I may as well key up your car
'Cause what you did to my heart that's an act of war
Well every step you take I'll be one step behind
Won't let you get me out of your mind

I hope you can't live without me
Can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe
Can't get your mind to stop thinking about me
Can't eat can't sleep, can't breathe

Cause you're perfume isn't loud
And only I can talk about
Feel good, feel good

You feel like velvet rubbing over my skin
And then your hair dances under my chin
Wish we were alone baby
Just the two of us
Yes every move you make
Gives me a rush

Wine some more, show me that love
Unconditionally
Make believe we're alone,
Just you and me

Battering down sentence,
Fighting against convictions
I find myself growing
In an environment

Where finding food
Is just as hard as

Paying the rent
In trodding these roads of trial
And tribulations
I've seen where

Some have died in desperation
To keep

Battering down sentence,
Fighting against convictions
Battering down sentence,
Fighting against convictions

In a family of ten
And raised

In the ghetto
Hustling's
The only education I know

Let me give you some love and affection
You got my attention
You need no correction
May Jah pour blessings in your direction
You've got my attention
What an impression

So long I've been waiting
To be with you all alone
I've been anticipating
The first time we kissed was breathtaking
And girl, we got a bright future in the making

When we are together
My heart feels so much better
Girl, I need you and that's no lie
Whenever that we make love
I breath Jah-Jah take cause
And I'm so glad that I made you mine
Keep that precious smile on your face
Jah will keep you warm and safe
Make it worthwhile

Come let we drink jelly water (yes-I)

From the hustle and bustle tonight

And I don't know where you wanna go
But I'm willing to take you there
Girl, just be who you wanna be
Once you're with me baby have no fear
So much beautiful things to see
Girl, don't waste your life
And there is only one love to give
Girl, we nah waste no time

And I don't know if a beach or if a river side
But I wanna take you somewhere tonight
And I don't know if a beach or if a river side
And I don't know if a hill or valley
But I beg ya come chill with Chronixx tonight

I wanna be loved
Not for who you think I am
Nor what you want me to be
Could you love me for me?
Real love, with no strings attached
I wanna give you my heart

You never see it coming
Then the next thing you know
Unconditional love
Unconditional love
She aint lookin for no diamonds
Ain't digging for no gold
Just somebody to love
Unconditional love

Oh no, no, not my baby

We were only strangers in the night
Getting to know each other the mood was right
Strolling under the moonlight
Hoping that we could get out of sight
And while the entertainer singing his song
I hold that feeling oh so strong
Never thought love would look me in the eyes
I lift my head, oh what a big surprise.
But there are people all around, who try to take your love from me
No, no, no
They don't seem to realize this love was meant to be

Only your love can set me free
I think I won the prize
From the very first time I looked in your eyes
I knew love would last forever
It's a blessing to be with someone like you
Now the ladies realize, I am no longer solo I got you by my side
And this new love I will treasure

No matter what colour, race or class it may be,
Flowing to me like a roaring river,
Dashing to the mighty sea.
It's burning hot, hot, one hundred point five degrees.

If loving you is wrong, i dont wanna be right.

I got my future front my eyes and the fight is to survive,
Baby this is just my life

So pass me the chalice let me bun it up,
Know you feel the vibe so baby turn me up
We livin in a time that so corupt,
So i do what i got to to break bread
Its want no warshed to all of the earth,
One other thing and me say na go toke apologie
Move it up the barn more me have fi med
And if its something bout the modern war, fool nah me said yao
Making a run through the states
But out a class shortly glad fi food for the place with no war
Just say your prayer for me
Girl i know that you will ride it for me a onetimer lets go

Rather risk my fredoom and my life, baby i'm a rider i'ma keep ridin
