He stopped, he took a deep breath, he said,
Woooooo, good morning, ladies.

I tell you what- my man on the guitar, fool on the drums,
Everybody just crowd around the mic, I'll tell you all these mutha-fuckin' jokes.
But first, I'ma start it off like this. Hey, help me sing it, homeboy.)
Colt 45 and two Zig Zags, baby that's all we need.
We can go to the park after dark, smoke that tumbleweed.
And as the marijuana burns we can take our turns, singing them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong, sell tapes from here to Hong Kong.
So roll, roll, roll my joint. Pick out the seeds and stems.
Feelin' high as hell flyin' through Palmdale, skatin' on Dayton rims.
So roll, roll the '83 Cadillac Coup de Ville.
If my tapes and my cds just don't sell, I bet my caddy will.

Well it was just sundown in a small white town. They call it Eastside Palmdale.
When the Afroman walked through the white land, houses went up for sale.
Well, I was standin' on the corner sellin' rap cds when I met a little girl named Jan.
I let her ride in my Caddy cause I didn't know her daddy was the leader of the Klu Klux Klan.
We fucked on the bed, fucked on the flo', fucked so long, I grew a fuckin' afro.
Then I fucked to the left, fucked to the right. She sucked my dick 'til the shit turned white.
I thought to myself, Sheba, Sheba! Got my ass lookin' like a ZEBRA!
I pulled on my clothes and I was on my way, until her daddy pulled up in a Chevrolet.
I ran. I jumped out the back window, but her daddy, he was waitin' with a 2 x 4.
Oh, he beat me to the left, he beat me to the right. The mutha-fucker whooped my ass all night.

I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack

""It's you and I, three o'clock sharp this afternoon you'll die""
I looked at my watch it was one twenty
""I already gave you my lunch money what more do you want from me?!""
He said ""Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse""

My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first

Something told me ""Try to fake a stomach ache, it works""

I screamed ""Owww! My appendix feels like they could burst!""

I just come up with these hits and lay low, collect my checks
She fuck with solid niggas (aye)
She don't be fuckin' with broke boys, I ran it up, that was my choice
She call me up when she need pipe, my girl ain't playin' with no toys
Watch my back, niggas lurkin', my girl look better in person

While you still try to follow where it is

Shine so vibrantly that eyes squint to catch a glimpse
Embrace the bass with my dark ink fingertips
Used to speak the King's English

My memory, I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch; not Trina, but I swear to God
This bitch'll make you call your girl up and tell her
""Hey, what's good?""
""Sorry I'm never comin' home, I'mma stay for good""
Then hang the phone up, and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said ""Nah, I was the same without it""
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches ""bitches"" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

One time for my LA sisters

Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'mma pick up a rock

Full house on my hands, the cards I was dealt

And everything I do or say today is worthwhile
Will for sure inspire actions in your first child
I'll begin my verse now

Sometimes I speak and I feel like it ain't my words
Like I'm just a vessel channeling inside this universe
I feel my ancestors unrested inside of me
It's like they want me to shoot my chance in changing society
But how do I go about it? Tell me where I start?
My destiny rerouted when I chose to follow heart
You told to follow suit, but tell me what it do for you?
Except weigh you down, now you trapped inside the cubicle they built for us
The first step into change is to take notice
Realize the real games that they tried to show us
300 plus years of them cold shoulders
Yet 300 million of us still got no focus
Sorry America, but I will not be your soldier
Obama just wasn't enough, I just need some more closure

We don't snatch chains, we find out addresses
And we don't leave messes

She say, what's missing? How you know something missing?

And she gave him some head

When I went to school I carried lunch in a bag
With an apple for my teacher 'cause I knew I'd get a kiss
Always got mad when the class was dismissed
But when it was in session, I always had a question
I would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and
Help me with my problem, it was never much
Just a trick, to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch

Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug
She was married to the man, he was a thug, his name was Lee, he drove a Z
He'd pick her up from school promptly at three o'clock
I was on her jock, yes indeedy. I wrote graffiti on the bus
First I'd write her name then carve a plus
With my name last, on the looking glass
I seen her yesterday but still I had to let her pass

She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by

When I dream of fairytales I think of me and Shelly
See, she's my type of hype and I can't stand when brothers tell me
That I should quit chasin' and look for something better
But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter
I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her
I just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture
I'm shootin' for her heart, got my finger on the trigger
She could be my broad, and I could be her nigger

Rollin' down hills 'cause life's a hastle
Encircled by my folly like a moat surround a castle
Stay afloat, catch a second wind

I wouldn't shoot you, bro, but I'd shoot that fool
If he played me close and tried to test my cool
Every day I wonder just how I'll die
Only thing I know is how to survive
There's only one rule in the real world
And that's to take care of you, only you and yours
Keep dealing with the hard times day after day
Might deal me some dope, but then crime don't pay
Black man tried to break in my house again
Thought he got off the dope doing time in the pen
Even though my brothers do me just like that
I get a lot of love so I'm giving it back to the ghetto

We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock
Doing the hole in the wall clubs,
This shit here must stop, like ""Freeze!""
We making the crowd move, but we not making no G's, and that's a no-no
Check it, a one-two, a one-two dope niggas in the Cadillac
They call us, went from Player's Ball to ballers
Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging
Niggas say mothafuck that playing,
They paying, we staying laying vocals
Locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry
""OutKast, yeah, them niggas, they making big noise""
Over a million sold to this day, niggas they take it lightly
'96 gon' be that year that all y'all
Playa haters can bite me, I'm out this bitch
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors

I packs more knowledge than confucious

I'm deadly, induce you like Medusa, with thoughts to shed
And niggaz throughout this hemisphere, far and near
Prepare, catch me chillin' like the winter
Up against the number one contender, as I enter

'Cause I gets heated like friction
Motherfuck your whole jurisdiction, react this fact not fiction
Telepathic addiction, to this homicidal recital
Dangerous and vital to all my rivals

Suicidal, brainwaves conveys
To the average motherfucker's minds these days
I'm all ready to put work in
Take ten steps and turn to shoot the first nigga smirkin'

Give a fuck, what's your name, what you claim
Or why you came, motherfucker don't explain
Simply, don't tempt me, 'cause I'm simply
Layin' hoes life's empty, the invincible MC

New York, New York big city of dreams
And everything in New York ain't always what it seems

Streets too loud to ever hear freedom ring
Say evacuate your sleep, it's dangerous to dream
But you chain cats get they CHA-POW, who dead now
Killin' fields need blood to graze the cash cow
It's a number game, but shit don't add up somehow
Like I got, sixteen to thirty-two bars to rock it
But only 15% of profits, ever see my pockets like
Sixty-nine billion in the last twenty years
Spent on national defense
But folks still live in fear like
Nearly half of America's largest cities is one-quarter black
That's why they gave Ricky Ross all the crack
Sixteen ounces to a pound, twenty more to a ki
A five minute sentence hearing and you no longer free
40% of Americans own a cell phone so they can hear, everything that you say when you ain't home

But we all so spoiled now
More life, more everything
Must have never had your phone tapped
All that yappin' on the phone shit
You must really love the road life
All that never comin' home shit

Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy

Dom Rosé toast
Hidden Hills, where I post
I start my day slow
Silk pajamas when I wake though
Miraval to the face though
I drunk text J-Lo
Old number, so it bounce back
Boi-1da got the bounce back

But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days

Verse one:

When I just a little niggerole
I looked up to my bigger bro
Begged if I could kick it so
When he went out with girls I could go taggin along
Naggin if she had a sis maybe could mack a baby hoodrat
Y'all remember way back then, when it was 1985
All the way live, I think I was about ten
One of those happy little niggaz singin the blues
That be always tryin to bag with the shag (and karate shoes)
Sayin ""yo momma black, his momma this, his momma that""
Then he get mad and wanna scrap
We stay mad about, ten minutes then it's like back on the bike
To play hide and go get it with the younger hoes by the bungaloes
Then switch to playin ding dong ditch, when that gets
Old and too cold to hack it, threw on a bomber jacket
You could tell the ballers 'cause they bell wearin gazelles
If they really had money raised be sportin bk's
And, all the girls had they turkish link
If it broke then they made earrings to it, like they meant to do it
But, sometimes, I still sit and reminesce
Then, think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Plus I'll tell you what the 80's like
And I know what ladies like
Need a man that's polite, listens and takes advice
I could be all three, plus I can lay the pipe
Come with me, come stay the night""
She looked at me laughing; like ""boy, your game is tight""
I'm laughin' back like, sure you're right, get in the car
And don't touch nothin', sit in the car
Let's discuss somethin', either we lovin' or I'll see you tomorrow
Now we speeding up the West Side

I just a fucked a rapper bitch, I should diss you
She sucked my dick, she came home, I bet she kissed you

Treat me like I'm Al Capone, nigga, fuck you
John Gotti, Illuminati, nigga, fuck you
I put a middle finger up, because, fuck you
This money got me geekin' up, nigga, fuck you
Red bottoms with the fur like Frank Luc
I bought some VVS and she caught the chain flu
I fucked this R&B bitch, I should thank you
Yah, I was sippin' my codeine from the beginnin'
She jocked my whole team, she seen who's winnin'
We light Liv up on a Sunday, come see us livin'
This for my dogs on the one way in penitentiaries
Send a direct hit, you gotta pay attention
I just lit my wrist up, I need some more attention
She didn't wanna play fair, I put her on suspension
I put a key on Greyhound now I'm in a new dimension
Offered her 25, keep tryin' to take some of my percentage
I was petrified you know my right wrist authentic
I get glorified, that Richard Mille cost 250
I'm a big dog, it ain't no sense in holdin' back

Neck and wrist laced up, very little make-up
The swims at the Reebok gym tone your frame up
Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of?
I tried to play it low key, but couldn't keep it down
Asked her to dance and she was like, ""Yo, I'm leaving now""
An hour later, sounds from Jamaica
She sipping Cris straight up, shaking, winding her waist up

Scene 2: my fam throwing the jam
Fareed is on the stand, big things is in the plans

Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on

Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town

Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was 14, with the four-track bussin'
Halfway cross that city with the back, pack, fat, cat, crushin'

Look my word is bond as fuck
My life is hard enough
They not rewarding us
They disregarding us
And if I go to D.C, I'm tryna spar with Trump
I'm not a politician, just can't ignore the stuff

This really just a free verse, I put my life in reverse
I dug up out my old pain and put it on a t-shirt
So many sides to this shit, not here for the popular shit
Your own people will laugh when you on positive shit
Before I die, I'ma teach, I light a blunt and I preach
Ain't no facade you can see, that I can only be me
I got a daughter to raise, one day she gon' be a queen
I'm tryna get shit together, so she can have anything

My word is bond as fuck
My life is hard enough
They ain't rewarding us
They disregarding us
And if I go to D.C, I'm tryna spar with Trump
I ain't a politician, just can't ignore the stuff

I take this life how it come
Got heart but still won't show love
If I tell people where I'm from, they might think I gotta gun

Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up with street clothes, hand me a 9 and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughin' at base-heads, tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass, and
I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up, told brothers ""Back up!"" — the MAC spit
Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him back-flip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, ""Yo, my shit is stuck!""
Tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So, now I'm jettin' to the buildin' lobby
And it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as I be

Here come the D's, time to make breeze
And gun toss in full force

Blood flood your eye, fuck up your optics
Switch to killer instincts 'fore niggas pop shit

Nine pound we rocked in '96
Strike back with more hot shit
Illuminate, my team'll glow like radiation
With no time for patient or complication
Let's get it done right, my clique airtight
Trapped in a never-ending gunfight
So niggas lose stripes or lose life
Jail niggas sendin' kites to the street
Over some beef that wasn't fully cooked
Finish 'em off, well-done meat
Then send 22 slug to your head
Travel all the way down to your leg

Ayo, it's Hell on Earth, whose necks are gonna be first?
The projects is front line and the enemy is one time
I ain't gotta tell you it's right in front of your eyes
Ayo, it's Hell on Earth, whose necks are gonna be first?

Milli stacked down, heavily guarded by hollow-tip slug
Then crack down on wannabe thugs
Adapt to gat sound and bow down
Slow the fuck up, see how my foul now

No need to fix what God already put his paint brush on

But these here breaks will rock your shoes

Had to hit my old town to duck the news

Now it's 4AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in Chase B mixes pop like Jamba juice
Different colored chains, see my jeweler really selling fruits
And they joking, man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic

We got thirty-six grams on the scale right now
Gettin' ready with my brothers time to break the shit down
I'm not about killin my people but you know how it go
Work with me not against me and well make mad dough

Wear my co-defendant out when I break down with rap
Hold me back and give me love and now I'm givin' it back
A unique sound from the streets and it's just so sweet
My livin' proof life story, let me break it in piece

Yo I rock on the block with the real hip-hop
As you start to clock... and jock
Yo, I'm comin' off with mad rage
Eighteen, and hittin' the real stage

But don't worry bout me, 'cause I'm makin' it

I'm a play, watch all 'em fall in the grave and lay
Pullin' in the driveway, wish spotted the place and quickly rolled up
Bulldozed through the living room
Hopped out of the car and started to blow up
Buck, Buck, and a kaboom
Me blew all them bodies all over the room
Them doomed
And gotta move fast, why?
The po-po's comin'
Snatch up me yummy
So nigga don't think it's funny
I'm comin' up quick in the nine-quat
'Cause flesh be lovin' this money

I'm given you love to the hustlers
All them St.Clair thugstas makin' that money stayin' on your feet
And you better believe gotta have that cheese
For the green leaves, never catch me sleep

Run a mile - for the cause, I'm righteous above the law

Forget the fame, and the glamour

Point blank, they can kizz my black azz
I didn't stutter when I said ""Fuck Tha Police""
Cause it's hard for a nigga to get peace
Now it's broken and can't be fixed
Cause police and little black niggers don't mix so
Now I'm creepin' through the fall
Runnin' like a team, well, see, I might have slayed y'all
So for now pack the gun and
Hold it in the air, cause MC Ren has a 100 Miles of Runnin'...

Into this news. Four fugitives are on the run.
FBI sources tell us that the four are headed 100 miles to their homebase, Compton.

Lend me a mutherfuckin' ear
So I can tell you why...

Runnin' with my brothers, headed for the homebase
With a steady pace on the face that just we raced

So listen close, to what we say
Because this types of shit happens every day
I woke up around 10 o'clock in the mornin'
I gave myself a strech up, a mornin' yawn and

Went to the bathroom to wash up
I threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup
And said um ""Mirror mirror, on, the wall""
""Who is the top Dogg of them all?""

There was a rubble dubble, five minutes it lasted
The mirror said, ""You are you conceited bastard""
Well that's true, that's why we never have no beef
So I slipped off my khakis and my gold leaf

Used Oil of Olay, 'cause my skin gets pale
And then I got the file, for my fingernails
I'm true to the style on my behalf

He was the greatest Samurai in the empire
And he was the Shogun's decapitator
He cut off the heads of a hundred and thirty-one lords
It was a bad time for the empire
The Shogun just stayed inside his castle and he never came out
People said his brain was infected by devils
My father would come home, he would forget about the killings
He wasn't scared of the Shogun, but the Shogun was scared of him
Maybe that was the problem
Then, one night, the Shogun sent his Ninja spies to our house
They were supposed to kill my father, but they didn't
That was the night everything changed-

See, sometimes
You gotta flash 'em back
See niggas don't know where this shit started
Y'all know where it came from
I'm sayin' we gonna take y'all back to the source

Alright, you kids get to bed, I'll get the storybook
Y'all tucked in?
Here we go

Once upon a time not long ago
When people wore pajamas and lived life slow
When laws were stern and justice stood
And people were behavin' like they ought ta good
There lived a little boy who was misled

By another little boy and this is what he said
Me and you, Ty, we gonna make some cash
Robbin' old folks and makin' that dash
They did the job, money came with ease

But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He robbed another and another and a sista and her brotha
Tried to rob a man who was a d.t. undercover
The cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic

He said, keep still, boy, no need for static
Punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap
But little did he know the little boy was strapped
The kid pulled out a gun, he said, why did ya hit me?
The barrel was set straight for the cop's kidney
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure
I'll do years if I pull this trigga

So he cold dashed and ran around the block
Cop radioes it to another lady cop

Be in the midst of the brother unlike another in any way

If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me

(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!) On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires

And I'm playin' with a new American dream, Dusty Rhodes
Man, she been ridin' clean since her daddy rode on vogues
I done fucked her in every hotelly, every hole
I ain't fucked her with my wife, but if she meet her she might be a go
Ric Flair, Ric Flair flashy, bitch, don't I look dashin'?
Bitch don't I look classy, bitch, don't act so sassy
I'm the, I'm the man boo, that's with or without you
To hell with what your mouth say, show me what that mouth do

I hear 'em talking hella reckless, I won't even stress
Just kill 'em softly with my presence, won't even address it
They say it's lonely at the top, but this the best shit ever
Hey don't you see me out here shinin'? Bitch I'm barely flexin'
I hear 'em talking hella reckless, y'all won't even stress this
Just kill 'em softly with my presence, won't even address it

You live life on an everyday basis

Would you trust it?

You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em?
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends
And y'all curled in that little bitty Range
I heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party

Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry

But I could never right my wrongs

And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve all this tension
Dispensing these sentences, getting this stress
That's been eating me recently off of this chest

And I rest again peacefully
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eating or feeding my daughter
To not come and speak to me
I don't know you, and no, I don't owe you a mothafuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick if you tempt me

My tank is on empty, no patience is in me
And if you offend me, I'm lifting you ten feet in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you, I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?

Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how ya talkin' and where ya walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk

I really hate to trip but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool
I'm the kind of G that little homie's wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the street light

Been spending most their lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise

Look at the situation they got me facin'

Talk to the plug everyday except Cinco de Mayo
I still got me a Carlo
Still got Monte Carlo

Call my Rollie a Ralo
Call my AP a ""ap"" (Ap)
I ain't talking seat belts when I say that I'm strapped
I'm in love with my side ho

But I don't need a cigarette, know what I mean?

Don't it sound amazing 'cause every rhyme is made and

Thought of, Cuz it's sort of... an addiction
Magnatized by the mixing

Rhymes overflowing, gradually growing
Everything is written in the cold, so it can coin-
Cide, my thoughts to guide,

'Cause I never been defeated and I won't stop now
Keep your hands up, get 'em in the sky
For the homies that didn't make it and my folks locked down
I never went nowhere, but they sayin' ""Luda's back""
Blame it on that conjure, the hood call it Luda 'gnac
And I'm on this foolish track, so I spit my foolish flow
My hands go up and down, like strippers' booties go
My verses still be servin', tight like a million virgins
Last time on the Khaled remix, now I'm on the original version
Can't never count me out, y'all better count me in
Got twenty bank accounts, accountants count me in
Make millions every year (yeah) the South's champion (yeah)
'Cause all I do, all I - all I - all I - all I do is

Have you ever loved someone so much you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression
No, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you were their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma
Turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for turns on you despite you
What happens when you become the main source of pain

Dad's gotta go catch a plane
""Daddy where's mommy?""
""I can't find mommy, where is she?""
I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, the song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you got to swing by yourself

Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spittin' image of her
That's Slim Shady
Yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight, Shady's rock-a-bye-baby, huh...

And when I'm gone, just carry on
Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so baby
Don't feel no pain, just smile back

Just hit the Eastside of the LBC
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G.
Seen a car full of girls ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213

So I hooks a left on the 21 and Lewis
Some brothas shootin' dice so I said, ""Let's do this""
I jumped out the ride, and said, ""What's up?""
Some brothas pulled some gats so I said, ""I'm stuck""

Since these girls peepin' me, I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Won'tcha think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix

I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they taking Warren's wealth

It's probably under ""Lil Dicky"", actually I'm a, I'm a rapper, so...
Okay, and who are you here to see?
Uh, Snoop Dogg? Says here ""Snoop D-o-g-g

Give him a knock and he should be right with you
Thanks, it's uh, this door right here, right?

Thank you

Grab a seat
Thanks I'm Dave very nice to meet
Dave, what it do? You can call me Dogg
Let me just check your sheet
No problem, sir, let me just say
I'm a big fan of the shit that y'all make
I can't lie, I been thinking about this all day
All good, there's a reason that we called, Dave
Let me start with your background
Where you come from?

Sure, I was undergrad down there in Richmond
Before that
Oh, you talking 'bout my hometown?
Yeah
I was born out of Philly grew up in a little silly old town called Cheltenham
It's in the suburbs, upper-middle wealth around
So real shit you ain't never had to struggle for much
I wouldn't say it like that, we just had a different kind of trap

Elaborate
Well I ain't never had a tool, but I had to be the man at school
Like I was doing shit I had to do
So when I finished undergrad, I'm cool
And I can get whatever job I wanted
But the job you wanted wasn't all that bumping
Yeah, and I saw it quick all the flaws that be coming
When you grow up like that
Know you been racing them rats, you ain't been making them raps

Boo hoo what a hardship
How you paid to get the rap shit started?
Man, my Bar Mitzvah money
But don't diss me buddy
I wasn't one of them youngins up on the block who had nothing to lose
I must've wanted this a lot, I had something to choose
Look at that, I can say there's something to prove up in your ass
Yeah, I guess
That's enough of the past, what makes you want to do rap?

Oh my God, it's the best
Bitches let me draw up on their breasts
Literally I can reinvent myself
I got a forum to project myself
It's never boring, every morning I wake up and try to best myself
I never got to be suppressed or stealthy to express myself
It's kinda healthy
Cool, now let me put you through a couple hypotheticals
Sure

In a club and a couple niggas threaten you
Uh, I wouldn't do shit
And I don't even get what that got to do with this?
Shut the fuck up, rap's like life
If you wanna do this, then you won't get far acting like a little bitch
Nah, that's my niche!
Don't get offended by this, but that's the market y'all missed
That's the target I'll hit
And that's the heart of my pitch

Told me he was in the gambling spot and heard the intricate plot
Of niggas wanna stick me like flypaper, neighbor
Slow down love, please chill, drop the caper

Remember them niggas from the hill up in Brownsville
That you rolled dice with, smoked blunts and got nice with?

Yeah my nigga Fame up in Prospect
Nah them my niggas nah love wouldn't disrespect

I didn't say them, they schooled me to some niggas
That you knew from back when, when you was clocking minor figures
Now they heard you're blowing up like nitro
And they wanna stick the knife through your windpipe slow
So, thank Fame for warning me cause now I'm warning you
I got the Mac, nigga tell me what you gonna do

But I'm not the only MC keepin' it real
When I grab the mic to smash a rapper, girls go, ""Ill""
Check the time as I rhyme, it's 1995
Whenever I arrive the party gets liver

Flow with the master rhymer, as I leave behind
The video rapper, you know, the chart climber
Clapper, down goes another rapper
Onto another matter, punch up the data, Blastmaster

Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everybody
Call up KRS, I'm guaranteed to rip a party
Flat top, braids, bald heads or knotty dreads
There once was a story about a man named Jed

But now Jed is dead, all his kids instead
Want to kick rhymes off the top of they head
Word, what go around come around I figure
Now we got white kids callin' themselves niggas

Round the corner from the pen
Fat house on the hill
All the homies in the pen straigt locked down
But I gotta get dressed and hit the oaktown
I called Randy Olson on the telephone
Early in the mornin but he still ain't home
So I called Ant Banks to see what's up
He said meet me at the studio at two o'clock
I got dressed, smokin on some serious dank
Grabbed my keys off the table and a bid ol bank
I hit interstate 80 and I'm rollin
Joint's still burnin and I'm smokin'
I was on my way to San Jose
To the stero shop that make my music play
Cause one amp shut down and the bass ain't playin
Didn't take long, for Joel and Janks to have me slumpin'
So I called up Boo, what's up nigga what you bout to do
He said, just kickin' back waitin on the fellas
Bout to go eat at Della's
I said it sure sounds good to me
I can't go tho, gotta hit Myrtle Street
Passed the acorns on my way, bitch. it's just anotha day

Big Banks came through and started mixin
Sittin in the studio kick back listenin
To some funky ass shit from the dangerous crew
Debbie D came through, with FM Blue
Shorty B rolled up smokin' fat ones
Pee-Wee had a crew in the back room
Goldie had the tramps givin head breakin off
Rap and rhyme that diddley-dog
Twin one and two is tellin stories

Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name!

Mike! - He doesn't need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
But fuck em, he knows the code
It's not about the salary
It's all about reality and making some noise
Making the story - making sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down Tak's picking it up! Let's go!

Who the hell is he anyway?
He never really talks much
Never concerned with status but still leaving them star struck
Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact
That many misjudge him because he makes a living from writing raps
Put it together himself, now the picture connects
Never asking for someone's help, or to get some respect
He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach
And now it all unfolds, the skill of an artist

This is twenty percent skill

And blew up my-my-myself again

How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida

Now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day

Niggas die everyday
All over bullshit, dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
Could this be 'cause of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?

When their back against the wall so they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blow I guess

Buckshot's the one that gets the job done
Mic check, I get paid to wreck your set
Get ready and jet, cause I'm a threat to your fret
No holds barred, and complete move fakers
Best to play the back and watch your girl, I might take her
If she's a crab I'm a diss her and slide
If she try to riff I got my Smith on my side
Word to God, here I come so make way
Rugged and rough, killing your set every day
Microphone check 1, 2, here we go
And I'm a let you know, who got the flow
Spitting my verbs like an automatic weapon
Suckers keep stepping, so I'm a let you know

Who got the props? *bo!*
Who got the props? *bo!*
5ft, Evil Dee, and Buckshot! *bo!* (Repeat 4x)

One Mississippi, two mississippi
Sucker tried to diss me so I played him like a hippie from the 60's
But I'm a get paid from the 90's
Quick to play you Little Rascals out like Stymie
Kicking flavor, with my life saver techniques
Guaranteed to move feets and I go on for weeks
Maybe years if my peers give me ears to fill

Think about back in the days when the year was '89
Little nigga on the grind, gotta get mine, doin' my crime with 2 in here, steady stackin' my ends, put my serve down on the Clair 9-9
Hittin' up the Graveyard Shift with Real, Little Will, Big Wally, and Wish Bone
Little Wally highrollers, and he wonder why niggas so strong
Krayzie Bone, stack, Rod J--much love, kept a nigga on his toes in the game
It's an everyday thang, when you let your nuts hang
Gotta make a grand at least daily, man.
Them Cleveland hustlas, never no bustas
Thug to the heartbeat of niggas from the Land fool, and the old school
Just serve out your sentence and be cool.
Fuckin' with trues
Rest In Peace, little nigga Ripsta, stressed that Bone love
Smokin' on bud, 'cause a nigga Mo Thug callin' all my niggas when it's time to nut 'em
In the 9-9, haters gonna drop to the #1 with the gun, so run run
Cleveland is the city where a nigga come from, slangin' them dum-dums

Niggas it's goin' down, up in the C-Town
Get 'em up with the thug (thug) and that nigga with the bud (bud)
Get the fifth of Rose, but the liquor store closed and I'm all out the forty, raise up, nigga
Burn up the buddah, smoke it all up nigga, don't stiff on the reefer
Mo runnin' up outta the cut with this fresh sack of hydro, and this shit is creeper
Peep the street, bust again on Double Glock-glock with-ah-me rocks
Cops sweatin' me block
Copper better drop when the gunshot pop, blood, dumpin' the body and the bullshit stop
Whenever the trouble knocks with the po-po, niggas roll solo, split up, and swerve
Krayzie take caution, take all my llello and tossed it
See none when they roll to the curb
Runnin', duckin', jumpin' up in the Land
My niggas, it's crazy

In an episode out in Hollywood, wilding out like Nick Cannon
Railing Adderall pills out a dollar bill, on the bathroom floor
Clean the whole mess up with my nose, what the fuck I need a vacuum for?
New York City on my birthday, June 6th, 2014
I had that first meeting with Hov, plus I brought out the whole team
I drank that whole bottle of D'usse Ty Ty gave me that night

She was the only one down for me

Stay loyal and stay down
By my side every night when I lay down
She would always pick me up when I break down
I knew her secrets, we both from the same town
She had everything that I need
But half of my lifestyle was high speed
She wants Netflix and chill and to light weed
She wants marriage and one day, my seed

Uh, but I'm movin' at light speed
And distance is stress, not what I need
FaceTime's, only when I see her face on live feed
Worlds apart so it's harder to succeed
Yeah, but true love is true pain
I felt like Bruce Wayne, the bolt like Usain
Had a hard time adjustin' to new fame

Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was looking at him different

That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shooting for if you ain't walking up, you fucking punk?
Picking up the fucking pump, picking off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch, a wall of bullets coming from

That's what momma said when we was eating the free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck your truce
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces BG's up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies
IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be calling your mother collect

They say the governor collect all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat

Wanna talk dough? I'm seein' more cash than a bank teller
Wanna talk girls, you can't follow this
I been through more skins than the average dermatologist

I'm no joke on a fast or slow tip
Pockets stay so thick, be on some down-low shit
I turn MC's red fast
I never sell out, fuck that, yo, I'm dead ass
I'm on it like TNT
When it comes to this, ain't another brother seein' me
That's why opponents always get scared
'Cause I make brothers go, ""Hey yo, now that's that shit there!""

I'm hip to the game (right)
I'll always be the same (true)

Broad and deep... why don't you listen and learn
Love mean happiness... that once was strong
But due to society... even that's turned wrong
Times have changed... and it's cool to look bummy
And be a dumb dummy and disrespect your mummy
Have you forgotten... who put you on this earth?
Who brought you up right... and who loved you since your birth?
Reward is a brainwashed kid goin wild
Young little girls already have a child
Bad company... hey, now you've been framed
Your parents are hurting... hurting and ashamed
You're ruining yourself... and your mommy can't cope
Hey, little kids don't follow these dopes
Here's a rule for the non cool... your life, don't drool
Don't be a fool like those that don't go to school
Get ahead... and accomplish things
You'll see the wonder and the joy life brings
Don't admire thieves... hey they don't admire you
Their time's limited, hardrocks too
So listen, be strong, scream whoopee-doo
Go for yours, cause dreams come true
And you'll make your mommy proud... so proud of you too

Just to get to kill 'em softly

Ooh, get them off me, try to crucify me
Like I'm Jesus the way she cross me
I'm too bossy and too thorough to move like a weirdo
On point like an arrow, we started off with zero
Now I'm seeing M's, diamonds like water and they jumping out the gym
Shooting like Harden if your head was the rim
'Cause niggas wanna line me like a shape up in the trim, damn

Back when I was broke, they was cool with it
Now every move I make, I'm in the news with it
Even if I ain't do it, they be like, ""You did it""
My teacher always used to tell me, ""You gon' lose nigga""
That's why I never went to school nigga
And why I'm rappin' like I got something to prove nigga
Went and bought the mansion with the pool in it
Billy with the stamp, I get two with it'

Move with it 'cause these niggas wanna take my life
No weapon formed against me, every time I pray at night
Scoopin' thotties in the Phantom, that's the way of life
And make them fuck their best friends like they was dykes
Reaching for the Glock, every time I play the light
I'm on 12 o'clock, every time I play them bikes

I'm with the pack, uh
Getting back, yeah
Spend dope, nigga
Selling smack, gang

It's like a jungle outside
Sometimes I wonder
How I keep from going under

We scream, ""Black Lives Matter,"" but we still toting ladders
Watching our own brothers trying to get at us
Dreams get shattered when a scene full of crackers
And they charge you with some shit you ain't do
You like, ""What happened?""
We go get lawyers to say shit, we don't know how to talk
They taught us to hate each other before we learn how to walk
Momma taught you how to fight, fight
'Fore she taught you how to write, write
And daddy locked down in the cell, can't kiss you night, night

Monsters under the bed every night, feel like it's fright night
Coke fumes in the air, mama holding on that pipe tight
And you catching contact, but never mind that
In a world where black is wrong and white right
It's like a combat, we go to war for our freedom, they say we equal
I used to wanna play like Randall and be an Eagle

I used to play the quarterback, my dog would go receiver
That was 'til ball got flat by a dope needle on the pavement
It's amazing, this environment we was raised in
On them papers, one mistake and getting caged in
You gotta feel me, feel like the system trying to kill me
Got arrested and the charges F1 for popping wheelies, stay woke

Though it's designed for us to fail

Just me and my horsey and a quart of beer
Ridin' cross the land, kickin' up sand
Sheriff's posses on my tail, 'cause I'm in demand

One lonely Beastie I be
All by myself without nobody
The sun is beatin' down on my baseball hat
The air is gettin' hot, the beer is gettin' flat

Lookin' for a girl, I ran into a guy
His name is MCA, I said ""howdy"", he said ""hi""

He told a little story that sounded well rehearsed
Four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst
The brew was in my hand, and he was on my tip
His voice was hoarse, his throat was dry, he asked me for a sip

He said ""Can I get some?""
I said ""You can't get none""
I had a chance to run
Pulled out his shotgun

Cole, world, yeah
Let me take y'all back man
As I do so well
Wasn't nothin' like that

Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first, time
She was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
I was a youngin' straight crushin' tryna play this shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school

'Cause when I seen 'em thighs on her
And them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreaming, man what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it
If she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up

As time goes by, attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin' thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad
And I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said
You ever had sex before?
Damn

And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

If you believe, then you can achieve just look at me!

Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me, protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious

Rock it down so jump up off the tip you're not my nucca

Hey madrigon sesa me bichafi mi chocha?
Say what I want because I'm that type of guy
Now fam a lam I'll be damned, slam jams the weak
Could it be the skunk weed that makes us oh so funky?

Now hold it let me choose, couldn't be the booze
No it's the shoes it's gotta be the shoes
'Cause girlies, they clock, they stand around and jock
So I say boom shaka lak, grab the microphone then rock

To think I'm the troop, when on the mic? I'll say it, it ain't the shows kid
Like drunk and a grump and sound over some
The cat in the hat and the mouse ran up the stairs
That doesn't make no sense, c'mon who cares?

See even without the gift there's yours so don't be tryin' to knock me
I say what I want to say, as long it sounds funk
Some MC's wanted to buy me, so they try to take stands
But they don't understand, I'm the motherfuckin' man

I amaze and astound, rhythm up and down
Smack a group of them around, let them know who wears the crown
Who's the tip of the top, the cream of the crop, the best under the sun?
I'm the Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Mr. Funke

The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka

And they still ain't ready yet for a mothafucka!
Yeezy might have to go and put his Louis on
I'm 'bout to go Gucci in the Gucci store

Fresh out the feds in this mothafucka
And they still ain't ready yet for a mothafucka
Gucci Mane and I'm 'bout to put my Yeezys on
Now that Gucci's home, it's over for you Gucci clones

1500, all in singles (straight up!)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
Round and round they go
Round and round they go
Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
Round and round they go
Round and round they go

Look, I say a prayer for my enemies
They cannot slow down what's meant for me
Funny how they come around like I can't see through their secret identities
Lately it's all about Zen and me
Subtractin' the negative energy
With the family, turn your ass to a memory
My niggas team of the century
I blow the check up, nigga, detonation
Kill 'em one by one, Final Destination
Time my destination

The birth of a child on the eighth of October
A toast but my granddaddy came sober

Countin' all the fingers and the toes
Now I suppose, you hope the little black boy grows, huh
18 years younger than my mama
But I really got beatings 'cause the girl loved drama

In single parenthood there I stood
By the time she was 21, had another one
This one's a girl, let's name her Pam
Same father as the first but you don't give a damn

Irresponsible, plain not thinking
Papa said, ""Chill"" but the brother keep winking
Still he won't down you or tear out your hide
On your side while the baby maker slide

But mama got wise to the game
The youngest of five kids, hon here it is
After 10 years without no spouse
Momma's gettin' married in the house

Listen, positive over negative for the women and master
Mother queen's risin' a chapter

Where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots?

Let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it fifty-fifty

Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga biggie, baby

Fuck waitin' for you to get it on your own
X gonna deliver to ya
Knock knock, open up the door, it's real
With the non-stop, pop pop and stainless steel

Go hard gettin' busy with it, but I got such a good heart
That I'll make a motherfucker wonder if he did it
Damn right and I'll do it again
'Cause I am right so I goes to win

Break bread wit' the enemy
But no matter how many cats I break bread with
I'll break who you sendin' me
You motherfuckers never wanted nothin' but your life saved
Bitch and that's on a light day

I'm gettin' down, down, maken niggas say freeze
But won't be the one endin' up on his knees
Bitch please
If the only thing you cats did is come out to play
Stay out my way
Motherfucker

First we gonna rock, then we gonna roll

But a year to make love she wanted you to wait
Let me tell ya a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. Nation
The way that I met her was on tour at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got onstage drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met
I whispered in her ear, ""Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if you are a hundred proof""
I asked her her name, she said blah-blah-blah
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said, ""How do you like the show?""
She said, ""I was very amused""
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, ""Do ya have a man, "" she tried to pretend
She said, ""No I don't, I only have a friend""
Come on, I'm not even goin' for it
This is what I'm goin' sing

And that they didn't like this
That Compton was the home of a foot in yo ass, where you got blast
And now that's just a thing of the past

Let me tell ya why firsthand, we did a show up in Oakland
And niggaz was kickin' up sand, to them bangin' ain't nothin' new
And slangin' ain't nothin' new
And for every nigga we done shot they done shot two
Straight through and on since the sixties before I was born
Families of young niggaz mourn
So I'm just letting you know
That if ya plan to take a trip to the bay keep your hand on the clip

Because Oakland

Yeah, I'm telling y'all Oakland
(It's jus lyke Compton for y'all)

With gold teeth ain't hey mouth, but they still know what's up
Where it's hot as a motherfucker, hot enough to make ya cuss
That's why I kept my ass on the bus

And met a couple of friends, who put us up on the St. Louis cap

I tell her, now go 'n' pop that pussy for a real nigga
I already know that life is deep but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hair net
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale, I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around, comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well just make sure that bitch is beautiful

Life on the edge, I'm danglin' my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me, nose bleed seats
And today I went shoppin' and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drumset
I've been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split

Uh
She just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, baby, it's real
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I can tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here
Baby you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won't, uh
But shit, then again, maybe she will

Tricky, swiftly, but yet viciously
It's always a mystery
Every day a new identity

Gemini, woke up on the wrong side of the sheets
Like really I shoulda been born on Halloween
I ain't no demon semen but I do evil deeds
My daddy don't ever see me, I ain't no devil's seed
I don't remember his last time checking up on me
Why you drop another album in a week?
I'm a wolf but I be dressing like a sheep
Put on my monkey suit and go orangutan

Popping monkeys, popping bottles, make me swing
Who the fuck you walking in and out my dreams?
I know I'm smart, you make me do some crazy things
Monkey on my back, let a nigga be
Please, niggas free out here but they ain't free
You out here physically, locked up mentally
'Bout everywhere I go, I gotta bring the ski
No face, no case, live everyday like Halloween

He had been shot right through the face, right in the neck
And he got shot right in the stomach

I put my hand to the sky, I sing
Grateful for the blessings you bring
Thank you for the ones I love
Forgive me for the times I was
Down and confused, I know
What I reap is what I will sow
Once again I find myself
Back with you from my hell

All I ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back
Get some money plus respect and now look, I got all of that
All I wanna do is see my granny on the other side
All I wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry
All I wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate
All I wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape

Right now I'm starin' out the window of my Range and contemplating, am I sane?
Have I sacrificed for fame?

Then they end up ownin' slaves
Justified it usin' Christianity which saves
Religion don't mean shit, there's too much ego in the way
That's why ISIS is a crisis
But in reality this country do the same shit
Take a life and call it righteous
Remember when Bin Laden got killed, supposedly?
In a hotel lobby after a show, was noticin'
These white ladies watchin' CNN, coverin' the action
They read the headline and then they all started clappin'
As if LeBron had just scored a basket at the buzzer
I stood there for a second, watched them high-five each other
For real? I thought this was ""Thou shalt not kill""
But police still lettin' off on niggas in the Ville
Claimin' that he reached for a gun
They really think we dumb and got a death wish
Now somebody's son is layin' breathless
When I was a little boy my father lived in Texas
Pulled up in Toyota, drove that bitch like it was Lexus
Put my bag in his trunk and headed off for Dallas
Out there for the summer, feelin' just like I was Alice
Lost in the Wonderland where niggas still sufferin'
Just like they was back home, and that's wrong
So now it's ""Fuck the government!""
They see my niggas strugglin'
And they don't give a fuck at all, and that's wrong, yeah

Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time

It's just amazing, girl, and all I can say is

And leave you with not much to go home wit

If I'm not at home, puffin lye relaxin

So I wear a slug-proof underneath my Guess

And to the drama I built, and all unfinished beef
You will soon be killed, put us together

And if not, they scarred, so they will never forget me
Lord forgive me the Hennesey got me not knowin how to act

That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because—

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
(It's the curse of the— it's the curse of the—)
I walk on water (Shit)
But only when it freezes

It's the curse of the standard
That the first of the Mathers discs set
Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
I've garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin' the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, ""This shit is garbage!""

The Abstract poet incognito, runs the cape
Not the best not the worst and occasionally I curse to get my
