You were next to me, now we're both alone

Tumbling thought now you're crumbling under me
Bodies turn away, nothing left to say
Progress isn't made
Hearts are far away
I can feel the pain in you drowning me
Why are you hiding all from me?
I start to think about how all I've ever wanted was you
And I would hold you in my arms until your heart could hear the truth
If you could be alone, you could be the one
To lie to me, don't lie to me
My eyes will never stray
It takes two hearts to open for love but right now... it's just me

How do I know if I still do?

Kill it with kindness
Kill it with reason
Be more like me

Be like your friends
Be like your mother
Be like your father
Be more like me

When love feels dead
And you got yours so, ha!
When love feels dead
And you got yours so
Pick up the feeling then let it drop

Turn off your phone

Mohawks in disarray from cutleridge to motherfucking Biscayne Bay
The gangs tried to kill us but we wouldn't take flight
Brass knuckles and rusty knives keep the wolves at bay
And we pray from traffic downtown, turn it up and take me away

What do you do when there's nowhere to go?
Empty pools and punk rock shows
After that nobody knows and the sun goes down and the streetlights glow
We rolled through the city in a bucket of rust
With the punk rock south day girls screaming lyrics at us
From the backseat kicking up dust to the sound of the only people we can trust

Out of control and you've shivered my timbers, I'm all fucked up
The Moon's just a sliver, yea, silence is golden but duct tape is silver
Like the lining of the clouds that conceal the killers

Of the storm the blood starts flowing
We're gathering bricks and we're gonna start throwing them at you (We'll throw them at you)

So let's take a drink and never think and here's to the past
She says it's so funny how life burns out so fast

And I used to say that I'd never stay
But I'm rotting here today
With that same old crowd that's always been around

The summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm driving by your house
Though I know you're not home

I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair combed back and these
Sunglasses on baby
I can tell you

My love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I never will forget those nights

And quoting lines from all those movies that we love
It still brings a smile to my face

Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up
These are the best days of our lives

Is the violence in our nature
Just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough?
Are we not brave enough?
To become something greater,
Than the violence in our nature
Are we not good, good enough?
Or is it all a dream?

An old man stood close by, smiled at me
I rang the bell like he did

Over the river is cold and black
And the bottom is a long way down

If everything goes smooth then you'll walk away a rich man""
So it begins, everybody walks in
Could this be the way or the day that the underdog wins?
I think not, so I bet on the feds
Because the black hat men never win in the end, so...

Ski mask (Check)
Sawed off (Check)
Guilty conscience, fear of death (Check, check, check)
Everything went numb when he stumbled upon what he thought
Was going to be another means to the end

On your street corner stops
Like most you try not to see me
You stare straight ahead
Ignore the responsibility
Excuse me... excuse me Mr.
I've been waiting in line
And I'd like to buy some of your time
I'm very anxious, eager, willing
What's your billing?

So please excuse me Mr.
You've got things all wrong
You make it feel like a crime
So don't confuse me Mr.
I've known you too long
All I need is a little of your time

For most love comes for free
They don't pay the high cost
Of mental custody I'll pay bail for a guarantee
Please make space for me In the time yet to be

I was tempted by your company
You've already noticed me
I'm sorry for what I say, when I don't know what I'm saying
And you don't have to play this cat and mouse game I am playing
I'm just a pretty sad person in a quite surreal place
And I don't look up from my phone 'cause I know I won't see your face
And it's pathetic
It's also not a competition

And I'm absolutely infinitely more scared of you than you are of me
And I've always been the one who cares too much

And I hope you're happy, I hope you've slept

When the lights are dim and your heart is racing
As your fingers touch his skin

I've got more wit, a better kiss
A hotter touch, a better fuck
Than any boy you'll ever meet
Sweetie, you had me

Girl I was it, look past the sweat
A better love deserving of
Exchanging body heat in the passenger seat

And no matter what you do about it, about it, about it
I'm still in your head

It's got me scared, scared of the unknown

A victim, still lying in bed, completely motionless
A hand moves in the dark to a zipper
Hear a boy bracing tight against sheets
Barely whisper, this is so messed up

Upon arrival the guests had all stared
Dripping wet and clearly depressed
He'd headed straight for the stairs
No longer cool, but a boy in a stitch
Unprepared for a life full of lies and failing relationships

He keeps his hands low

He's wet from head to toe and
His eyes give her the up and the down
His stomach turns and he thinks of throwing up
But the body on the bed beckons forward
And he starts growing up
