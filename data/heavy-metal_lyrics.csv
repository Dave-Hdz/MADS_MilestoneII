I realized life was a game
The more seriously I took things

My life passed before my eyes
I found out how little I accomplished
All my plans denied

So as you read this know my friends
I'd love to stay with you all
Please smile when you think of me
My body's gone that's all

A tout mes amis
Je vous aime
Je dois partir

Frayed end of our binding threads

Hear no, see no works its magic

Filter the nonsense and laugh at what's left
Indecision - nonvision, what matters taken away

Look at the shell that is you
Empty, fragile, weak
Soon, the battle is over
Lost to apathy

Be pushed through my veins again

Shifting my soul to what was heaven before and now's just a stain
A novelty no more

Passion and soul together deceiving my brain and I fall
But soon they will fade delighted by something else and now I rewind
One more time
Waiting for...

All my feelings now in vain
The divided heart

Tearing me apart, the divided heart
Playing its game for all these wasted years I have been walking alone
All these years I have been carried away, carried away

Våldets väsen mitt sinne nu dränkt

Krossar skallar, sargar ben
Sköljer min själ, tvättar den ren
I ett raseri, en storm av förlust
Ylar, förtär livets lust

Blodsvept
Från slag till slag
Tusen jag dräpt

In the dawn of terrestrial birth.
New-born yet older than time,
Conceived in the depths of the earth.

Though strange lay the waters from which they emerged,
They glanced upon the world as their own.
Yet deep in their hearts they knew all the time
That this was not really their home.

So they rode on.
Yes, they rode on.

On hidden roads, through barren wastelands,
Untrodden by both man and beast.
From the distance their fire was gleaming
Like a lamp amidst dark eternity.

A bitter moon hovered above them.
The night lit sole by its glow.
From high in a sky of ominous dye
In which dark clouds drifted slow.

Now there's a haze pushing me sideways
And leaving me nothing to gain
Taking me back
Locking me cold in disparity

I feel I'm lost in a dream
Long for the day I can be myself

When I'm free
When my sun has set
Released my soul forever

To be free
I'll exist again

Crawling on the filth of the dumpster floor
Only known to the mother in guilt
As she stumbles from the alley covered in flies
With a ten mile stare dead to the world

In another life she once had hope

You hear me say ""Get out of my way""
I'll do it my own way
Cross my path and get what you deserve

I'm warning this world
To stay out of my way
My voice will be heard
I'm alone

I won't be afraid
I got something to say
My voice will be heard
So loud, native blood!

Forever proud, so goddamn loud
It's me alone against the crowd
Right or wrong, it's the road that I must choose

There's no excuse, attitude

As I lay and wait to die
Little do they know
That I hear their choice of life

End it now, it is the only way
Too cruel, that is what they say
Release me from this lonely world
There is no hope, why don't you...

Pull the plug

Down to Asa bay
Where dragon ships had sailed to sea
More times than one could say
To see with own eyes the wonder
People told of from man to man
The God of all almightyness
Had arrived from a foreign land

The rumours told of a man
Who had come from the other side the seas
Carrying gold cross around neck in chain
And spoke in strange tongue of peace
He had come with strange men in armour
Dressed in purple shirts and lace
Smelling not of beer but flowers
And with no hair in face

And the bold man carrying cross
Had told all one of Asa bay
The God of all man woman child had come
To them all save
And to thank Lord of Heaven
One should build to God a house

Loneliness, yet with you autumn night as guest
But can you hear my cries?

Permeate me, oh night, as with the forest you did
For heart is cold, cold as ice

I drown in the color of your eye
For a black heart will only find beauty in darkness
I breathe it's eternity to absorb the sky
Where the shadows of death may lie

Feel the call, nocturnal desire
Sorrow's breath enchanting cries
Night's blood taste damnation's wine

You can subdue, but never tame me
It gives me a migraine headache
Sinking down to your level

Like a casket in a shallow grave

I have bled to death on every page
Watch as my heart turns to stone
Watch me die without hope

This is what I feared the most
Wanting love but chasing ghosts

And it won't matter when I forget your name
You know exactly what I am
