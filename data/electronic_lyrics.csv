Then it's on to the next one, on, on to the next one
Hard to move on when you always regret one

I wonder sometimes
I wonder if I was wrong
Tryna do right by you got me here
Now all I am is alone

'Cause her eyes and those hips
And that ass
Don't compare, at all, no
And at best, all they do is distract me
But now, deep down, when I face it

All I want is you

Now that you're gone, gone, gone

'Cause being your friend was killing me softly

Live like a hippie if you wanna be king

Everybody loves somebody to hate

I'm not gonna go and rush this through my veins

Said all the weak can get to prison
I wanna write about setting something free
All the changes drive us back to see

Just the feeling like you're gonna die

The dark is too hard to beat

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone

'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone

That's all we need because it's all we can take

One thing I never see the same when your 'round
I don't believe in him, his lips on the ground
I wanna take you to that place in the ""Roche""
But no one gives us any time anymore

He asked me once if I'd look in on his dog
You made an offer for it, then you ran off
I got this picture of us, gets in my head
And all I hear is the last thing that you said

""I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine""
I didn't want to anymore, oh oh oh

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?

Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend

And we will never be alone again

Can I give it up or give it away?

Are gone in a moment

Locked in the basement

I wake up and the phone is ringing
Surprised as it's early

Swimming in December
Heading for the city lights in 1975

We share in each other
Nearer than farther
The scent of a lemon drips from your eyes

We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world
Take me now, we can try

We lived an adventure
Love in the summer
Followed the sun till night
Reminiscing other times of life

For each every other
The feeling was stronger
The shock hit eleven, got lost in your eyes

I can't do well
When I think you're gonna leave me
But I'm gonna try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?

You walk around in shoes that don't fit for a change
There is no way for you to win this race
Criss cross you turn your shirt inside out
You like to think I can't figure you out, but the tables have turned
What goes around comes around, you're about to get burned
Flip the script, you're checking in, I'm checking you out

You're just too sweet till you get on my nerves and hurt like cavity
You left a bad taste in my mouth, my Sour Patch Kid
You and me, it's no mystery, no magic trick
Let me hear this broken record again, just press repeat

I can be your new favorite waste of time, and you'll be mine
All I want is your attention, it's all the same thing
Are you in? What's it gonna be?
Don't roll with the punches, make it hard for me baby.

Drop you like a needle on the record, scratch my itch
Watch you walk in circles hit the beat

No heartbroke, I hit the road

And started seeing, started seeing what we're doing
Still doing everything we want to
And maybe one day we'll go to rehab
Or back to Argentina, it's not that far away

Put your hands to the side, as silly as it seems

You know you only can go further away

When did we grow up and when did we lose
Everything we were so sure about then

But I'm finding now love's unreliable
I'm given all I got to make you stay
Or am I just a roadblock in your way?

'Cause you're a pretty little windstorm
On the boulevard
Something like a sunset
Oh yeah, a shooting star
And I might drive myself insane
If those lips start speaking my name

'Cause I got some intuition
Or maybe I'm superstitious
But I think you're a pretty sweet pill that I'm swallowing down
To counter this addiction
You got me on a mission
Tell me, darling, can I get a break somehow?
Could I say no?

Girl's got a love like woe (Woe oh, oh, oh)

This is our decision, to live fast and die young
We've got the vision, now let's have some fun
Yeah, it's overwhelming, but what else can we do?
Get jobs in offices and wake up for the morning commute?

Forget about our mothers and our friends
We're fated to pretend

I need some balance in my ears right now

And I've been waking this whole town.

And then I turned myself inside out
La da da da da
And it's all about
The way your hips move
Side to side,
Left to right,
Guide me home tonight.
And I need a little more thunder, a little more lightning.
A little more you,
Be my lantern.
Help me shine on through.

So I said,
I, I gotta comb my brain for the words to say.
And if you don't feel right then it's a wasted night-
The price to pay is so, so high.
And the irony could be cut with a knife.
'Cause its my first chance.
But it's my last chance.

How do I say that I need to move on?
You know we're headed separate ways

I can't lie no more, I can't hide no more
Got to be true to myself

Before my name started tripling in size
But I'm still showing signs all the (?) align

I'm all alone take me back to the roads I had to roam
To get here and I'll hitch back
Get a cab to my mother's house,
See my old man and grab a six pack
Tell my brother I love him
And give him something that will see him through the hard times
What's a brother for?
When I'm sick of this life I see,
It has to be my family who lift me off the floor.

I was a failed man and worse I couldn't give a f*ck
Save your wine for the entrepreneurs

Wondering where to go
To run away
Without you
All my fame is coming home
And it's ripped out for the soul
You can't be me
I will become you tonight

I was wandering under black skies
Clutching at what is mine
No control
Left to lose
Well I thought that it wouldn't faze me

Press down the dirty floor with all these __ ticket stubs

Up above

I'm a man I've got reasonable abilities
And I was told that there gonna be some use to me
What ever happened to the things I would reflect upon
I guess I'm losing track

Stop, I'm shock through
My shape is changing,
