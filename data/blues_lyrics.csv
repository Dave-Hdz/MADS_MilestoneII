I'm pretty fast myself.
But I do have some advice to pass along
Right here in the words of this song.

You better not look down,
If you wanna keep on flying.
Put the hammer down,
Keep it full speed ahead.
You better not look back,
Or you might just wind up crying,
You can keep it moving
If you don't look back!

That girl have lived in love and for love
And over love, and under love all her life

Used to know a girl that lived down there
And she'd go out in the evenings and pick her a mess of it
Carry it home and cook it for supper

There lived a girl that I swear to the world

Brought me fame

Sometime when I'm blue seem like Lucille try to help me call my name
I used to sing spirituals and I thought that this
Was the thing that I wanted to do
But somehow or other
When I went in the army
I picked up on Lucille
And started singing blues
Well
Now when I'm paying my dues
""Maybe you don't know what I mean when I say
Paying dues, I mean when things are bad with me""
I can always, I can always
You know like uhm
Depend on Lucille
Sort of hard to talk to you myself
I guess I'll let Lucille say a few words and then

I doubt if you can feel it like I do

Like, well for instance
If I have a girlfriend
And she misuses me, and I go home at night

A roach turn up the wall
Everything is noisy around her
That don't seem to bother her at all

About the house-man blues
I come home one Friday
Had to tell the landlady I'da lost my job
She said that don't confront me
Long as I get my money next Friday
Now next Friday come I didn't get the rent
And out the door I went

So I goes to the landlady
I said you let me slide?
I'll have the rent for you in a month
Next I don't know
So said let me slide it on you know people
I notice when I come home in the evening
She ain't got nothing nice to say to me
But for five year she was so nice
Loh' she was lovy-dovy
I come home one particular evening
The landlady said you got the rent money yet?
I said no, can't find no job
Therefore I ain't got no money to pay the rent
She said I don't believe you're tryin' to find no job
Said I seen you today you was standin' on a corner
Leaning up against a post
I said but I'm tired, I've been walkin' all day
She said that don't confront me
Long as I get my money next Friday
Now next Friday come I didn't have the rent
And out the door I went

So I go down the streets
