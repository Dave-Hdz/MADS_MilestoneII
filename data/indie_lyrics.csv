Lick a rock on foil (come forth)

Dress me up in ecstasy

Hell is round the corner where I shelter
Ism's and schisms, we're living helter skelter
If you believe or deceive
Common sense says shouldn't receive
Let me take you down the corridors of my life

And when you walk
Do you walk to your preference?
No need to answer till I take furthur evidence
I seem to need a reference to get residence

A reference to your preference to say
I'm a good neighbor, I trudge
So judge me for my labour
The bond on me ensures my good behavior
The constant struggle ensures my insanity

Passing the ignorance ensures
The struggle for my family
We're hungry beware of our appetite
Distant drums bring the news of a kill tonight

I'll grab my bat

Won't say that I never tried

Of how we made something of ourselves now

Ornamental parts of love and parts of memories so
Everything else has room to grow

My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

32 hundred on the jacket like Magic Johnson
Got a couple chains off Slauson
Silhouette lookin' like Charlie's Angels
I loose up with a drip of sangria
Wipe that, smirk, life ain't that serious
Love when you're double bunned up like Leia
Make me wanna check my blood pressure
Am I bein' too obvious?
I got a crush, it's nothing else
I swear, it's nothing else
Wake up, feelin' like Adriana Lima
Wavin' my feet, yo, right up out the Beamer
Do my dance like, ""Ooh, la, la!""
When she strut like, ""Oh my God!""
Make me sweat like exercise
Double up, milkshake and fries

I heard a call from the mountain top, ""Joba!""

If this is heaven
I don't know what it's for
If I can't find you there
I don't care

I thought I found a way to enter
It's just a Reflektor
I thought I found the connector
It's just a Reflektor

Now the signals we send
Are deflected again
We're still connected
But are we even friends?
We fell in love when I was nineteen
And I was staring at a screen

Entre la nuit
La nuit et l'aurore
Entre les royaumes
Des vivants et des morts
If this is heaven
I need something more
Just a place to be alone
'Cause you're my home

I thought I found a way to enter

And then they went on to say that the pearly gates
Had some eloquent graffiti

Like ""We'll meet again"" and ""Fuck the man""
And ""Tell my mother not to worry""
And angels with their gray handshakes
Were always done in such a hurry

We'd forgotten one another

Only now it seems so silly

Silence is what I do best
Still I hear it all
Wasting time around my head
So I talk to myself instead

Sitting out the weekend
Couldn't do it again
Say you want it right now
But I wouldn't know how
It's something that I can do
But how am I supposed to?

Something awkward but new between us
Something strong and appealing

And we both had girl- and boyfriends blowing us up SMS
But we both knew a mood like this so strong would be wrong to suppress
Felt like it bore the impress of destiny
In a minivan in New England, our eyes met
We said yes and we said yes

At the face that I could not see

You set me straight and low
With your fists up and your bracelet

The hours the minutes the seconds
The more you are will I be
Will I be me

There may be dogs at the door
But you are a lottery winner
And maybe it's my heart that
That keeps me dreaming
Rise and shine
The dirt in your eyes

Look, you could meet someone you like
During the meteor strike, it is that easy
Lunar surface on a Saturday night, dressed up in silver and white
With coloured Old Grey Whistle Test lights

Take it easy for a little while
Come and stay with us, it's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
Since the exodus, it's all getting gentrified
I put a taqueria on the roof, it was well reviewed
Four stars out of five
And that's unheard of

Hokey Cokey with the opposite sex
The things you try to forget, doesn't time fly?

But no one knows when the Batcave closed
The river goes where the water flows

No promise sweeter than a blood pact

I nearly lose my grip, but you held on to me
And you shake me, and tell me that I'm okay, but

I swear they smell the blood on me
I hear them coming for me

Well, you're so pretty and I love you so
You know I'm your biggest fan
I saw your picture and it's the best
The finest in the land

In Hollywood of Hell

When the curtain falls
Walk the hollow walls, babe
Once a valley doll
Now you're not at all, no

Sometimes my head bangs
I'm kinda hooked on your scent

A funny trick, a head shake
I wanna peek, I wanna sip
I show a funny trick, my head shake
Giving me a peek, giving me a sip
