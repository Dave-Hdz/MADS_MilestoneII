Ready to pour
Dressed in all that satin and lace to the floor
So I went in
Then we sat down start kissing
Caressing
Told me about Jacuzzi
Sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answer phone
Please leave a message after the tone

I'm not being mean
Her parents were kinda cool
But they ran a fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents trying to find out what we were up to

Asking myself why you do this to me, oh baby

To tell you, baby face to face
I'm writing you this letter

All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead you told me lies
When someone else was on your mind
What'd you do to me? Look what you did to me

I thought that you were someone who would do me right
(Do me right)
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry

And made a fool of me baby, you got it all wrong

I'm the desert without the sand

I'm a ring without a hand

Nope!
Didn't think so

How you doing, young lady?
That feeling that you giving really drives me crazy
You don't have a player on the truck
I was at a loss of words first time that we spoke
You looking for a girl that'll treat you right
You looking for her in the daytime, with the light
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night
You expect me to just let you hit it
But will you still respect me if you get it
All I can do is try, gimme one chance
What's the problem, I don't see no ring on your hand
I'll be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent
You wanna' get in my world, get lost in it

Boy, I'm tired of running, let's walk for a minute

Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, you already know
That I'm all yours, what you waiting for?
Promiscuous girl, you're teasing me
You know what I want, and I got what you need

Promiscuous boy, let's get to the point

Growin' up in Spanish Harlem
She livin' a life just like a movie star

Oh, Maria, Maria
She fell in love in East L.A.
To the sounds of the guitar, yeah, yeah
Played by Carlos Santana

Stop the lootin', stop the shootin'
Pick-pockin' on the corner
See as the rich is getting richer
The poor is getting poorer

In my mailbox there's an eviction letter
Signed by the judge said, ""See you later""

I got stopped by a lady cop
She got me thinkin' I can date a cop
'Cause her uniform pants are so tight

She read me 'bout them rights
She put me in her car, she cut off her lights
She said I had the right to remain silent
Now I got her hollerin' soundin' like a siren

Talkin' 'bout
Wee ooh, wee ooh, wee
Wee ooh, wee ooh, wee
Wee ooh, wee ooh, wee

And I know she the law and she know I'm the boss
And she know I can hide above the law
And she know I'm raw, she know it from the street
And all she want me to do is fuck the police

Talkin' 'bout

To be somebody else (Else)

Another story to tell

When you got somebody good
You hold on to em'

Must be nice
Having someone who understands
The life you live
Must be nice
Having someone who's slow to take
And quick to give

Must be nice
Having someone who sticks around
When the rough times get thick
Someone who's smile is bright enough
To make the projects feel like a mansion

Must be nice
Having someone who loves you
Despite your faults

Must be nice
Having someone who talks the talk
But also walks the walk

Must be nice
Having someone who understands
That a thug has feelings too

I feel like I'm King Kong
Name still going ding-dong
It's two girls gettin' more money
And they don't rap, they sing songs
I stay with that pink on
Pink furs and them pink thongs
Goons out if they blink wrong
Think hard, but don't think long

Pink Friday had Eminem
Spit hard but I'm feminine
Iconic trio on Monster
Goblins and gremlins
What's left that I didn't do?
You bit the forbidden fruit
You thought you'd get my spot?
Who the fuck was kiddin' you?

Took a lil' break, but I'm back to me
Tryna make a new Nicki, where the factory?
They'll never toe to toe on a track with me
There'll never be another one after me
'Cause the skill level still just a half of me
Blasphemy, my niggas will blast for me
All these low IQ hoes baffle me
Tell 'em that I wash bitches take a bath for me

Bunch of trophies in my crib like a athlete

I know that you ain't coming back
In the beginning everything was cool
Toward the end of it all it's all bad
I know I played my part in making it what it is
And I know that you did the same
I guess I'm up outta here
I'm moving on again
I'm sure that you will understand
I play by the rules
You play by the game

It's easier to say
Cos I was by your side
When you went through the pain
I guess it doesn't matter now that you're so far away

And every minute you're gone
I'm missing you so
I can't believe that you're far away

Didn't want you to go babe, babe

Do I need you? Am I sure? Not really
So you might never get to see me naked, nah-nah-nah

Bad for you, love that is worth the deal is
Can't get enough of this
Said you tryna hit and quit
But you need me like a cigarette

So baby come and get it right now, now, now
I can take you higher, then low, low, low
I'm bad for you love, but I'm your cigarette

R.I.P. to B.I.G.
Classic shit

I'm looking for a nigga to give some babies
A hand full of Weezy, sprinkle of Dave East
Man, I ain't got no type, like Jxmmi and Swae Lees
But if he can't fuck three times a night, peace
I tried to fuck 50 for a powerful hour
But all the nigga wanna do is talk Power for hours
B-beat the pussy up, make sure it's a K-O
Step your banks up like you're moving that ya-yo

Somebody go and make sure Karrueche okay though
I heard she think I'm tryna give the coochie to Quavo
They always wanna beat it up, goon up the pussy
Man, maybe I should let him autotune up the pussy
All these Bow Wow challenge niggas lying and shit
Man, these Fetty Wap niggas stay eyeing my shit
Drake worth a hundred milli, always buying me shit

But I don't know if the pussy wet or if he crying and shit
Meek still be in my DMs, I be having to duck him
""I used to pray for times like this""
Face ass when I fuck him
Man, Uzi is my baby, he ain't takin' an L
But he took it literally when I said, ""Go to hell""
Used to fuck with Young Thug, I ain't addressing this shit
C-caught him in my dressing room, stealing dresses and shit
I used to give this nigga with a lisp testers and shit
How you want the pu-thy? Can't say your S's and shit

Dreams of fucking one of these little rappers
I'm just playing, but I'm saying
Dreams of fucking one of these little rappers

Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes, 'cause
I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you

It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the benjamins?
You act like you ain't hear him, then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again
Plus when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again
Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim sleeping with the gin
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass 'cause you thinkin' it's a trend, girlfriend
Let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Yo, he's messed up and you still defending him now

Try to control me, boy, you get dismissed
Pay my own fun, oh, and I pay my own bills
Always fifty fifty in relationships

The shoes on my feet, I've bought it
The clothes I'm wearing, I've bought it
The rock I'm rockin', I've bought it
'Cause I depend on me if I want it

The watch I'm wearin', I've bought it
The house I live in, I've bought it
The car I'm driving, I've bought it
I depend on me, I depend on me

All the women, who are independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys, who making money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mommas, who profit dollars
Throw your hands up at me
All the ladies, who truly feel me

Coming from afar
Reaching for the stars
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
From one corner to another, uh-huh

Some got hopes and dreams
We got ways and means
The supreme dream team always up with the schemes
From hubcaps to selling raps, name your theme
My rise to the top floating on this cream
Who the hell wanna stop me, I hated those who doubt me
A million ReFugees with unlimited warranties
Black Caesar, dating top skeezers
Diplomatic legalese; no time for a Visa
They just begun, I'mma shoot them one-by-one
Got five sides to me, something like a pentagon

So you hide away, shelter from the rain

I see it written on the wall
And I've been walking through my own disaster
Thinking it's time to move on

Gotta leave my candlelight burning
If it goes out, I would lose it
Gotta let my candlelight

I lay my head on my pillow
Staring out the window
Wish on a star for a sign

When it's all over, breathe into the light
Sink or swim, I'm not scared to die

Tell 'em how you feel, Kenny

As I walked through the subway
It must have been about quarter past three
In front of me
Stood a beautiful honey with a beautiful body
She asked me for the time
I said it'd cost her a name
A six digit number and a date with me tomorrow at nine

Did she decline? No
Didn't she mind? I don't think so
Was it for real? Damn sure
What was the deal? A pretty girl, age 24
So was she keen? She couldn't wait
Cinnamon queen? Let me update
What did she say?
She said she'd love to rendezvous
She asked me what we were gonna do
Said we'd start with a bottle of Moet for two

Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday
We chilled on Sunday

Let's 1-2-touch, need one more touch
What a waterfall, what a waterfall
You can put me up like I'm a portrait on a wall
I make the winter time shine, feel like the Bahamas
I got your name stored, a special ringtone when you call
Don't nothing change but the seasons
When it springs, I'ma fall

If I throw it back just like a ol' school
Can you take it back just like a ol' school track
If I throw it back just like a ol' school
Can you take it back just like a ol' school track

Want hundred percent of your 12 play
Confessions, you're gettin' in my way
Can you stand the rain like Bobby
Who gon' Keith Sweat you? Nobody
From the window to the wall

Make my hips hop and hooray

In my time I've travelled some roads
A rolling stone
Nowhere feels like home
And I've seen people come, then they go
Life is just a story of some highs and some lows

Tell me do you believe in miracles?
I'm standing here before your eyes

I've cried many rivers
I've walked through some pain
I've seen my world crumble
And I'll carry the shame
But I know somebody, He calls me His own
I can hear heaven singing out
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone

What a king's supposed to be

Let's take a long walk
Around the park, after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation

Share our situations
Temptations, education, relaxations
Elevations
Maybe we can talk about Surah 31:18

Your background, it ain't squeaky clean
Shit, sometimes we all gotta swim upstream
You ain't no saint, we all are sinners
But you put your good foot down to make your soul the winner

I respect that
Man you're so phat
And you're all that
Plus supreme

Then you're humble
Man I'm numb yo
With feelin'
I can feel everything that you bring
