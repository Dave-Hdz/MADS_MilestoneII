As he goes left, and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence

Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along

I can't control myself
So what if you can see the darkest side of me
No one will ever change this animal I have become
Help me believe it's not the real me

Somebody help me tame this animal
(This animal, this animal)
I can't escape myself
(I can't escape myself)

I drive all night just to get back home

Sometimes it's not for days
The people I meet
Always go their seperate ways
Sometimes you tell the day

And if you interact
Your life is on contract
Your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker
It's just one of those days

It's all about the ""he says, she says"" bullshit
I think you better quit, lettin' shit slip
Or you'll be leavin' with a fat lip
It's all about the ""he says, she says"" bullshit
I think you better quit, talkin' that shit

It's just one of those days
Feelin' like a freight train
First one to complain
Leaves with a blood stain
Damn right, I'm a maniac

Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping

Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light

Seems our freedom's up

Against the ropes

Is it East versus West

Can any nation stand alone

Just about to burst
There's a quest for answers

An unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night
Rising like a spire
In the burning heart

Remember when you used to be a rascal?

Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
But not as daft as they seem, not as daft as they seem
My love, when you dream them up

Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when she's told she's gonna get it

I feel the ground start to shake
I hear a voice shouting ""No""
But there is no fucking way
I'd leave you

So I'll just hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now,
Like a house on fire we're wrapped in flames
I'd burn you if that's what it takes

When they live in the sins of yesterday
Cast off the crutch that kills the pain
The red flag wavin' never meant the same
The kids of tomorrow don't need today
When they live in the sins of yesterday

Well, I've never seen us act like this
Our only hope is in minds of kids
And they'll show us a thing or two
Our only weapons are the guns of youth
It's only time before they tighten the noose
And then the hunt will be on for you

The red flag waving never meant the same, no
The red flag waving never meant the same

Cast off the crutch that kills the pain
The red flag wavin' never meant the same
The kids of tomorrow don't need today
When they live in the sins of yesterday
Cast off the crutch that kills the pain

I had a cane and a party hat
I was the king of this hologram
Where there's no such thing as getting out of hand

Memories tend to just pop up
Drunk pre-meds and some rubber gloves
Five thousand people with designer drugs
Don't think I'll ever get enough (don't think I'll ever get enough)

Champagne, cocaine, gasoline
And most things in between
I roam the city in a shopping cart
A pack of camels and a smoke alarm
This night is heating up
Raise hell and turn it up

Beneath the marquee

Steak-knife
Card shark
Con job
Boot cut

Skin that flick
She's such a little DJ
Get there quick
By street but not the freeway

Turn that trick
To make a little leeway
Beat that nic
But not the way that we play

Dog town
Blood bath
Rib cage
Soft tail

We wait to reap what we are due

To the rhythm of a timebomb ticking away
And the blare of the sirens combing the streets

I've been wondering just what would peace be like
I've been staring into headlights
Swallow me whole, finding my peace of mind
I'm just trying to seize the moment
Trying to love the little things, even if they're hard to love
A monument to love unspoken
Carved into stone ""Unwilling to come undone""

It feels good to be running from the devil
Another breath and I'm up another level
It feels good to be up above the clouds
It feels good for the first time in a long time now

I remember back in Oakland
I was lying there in rapture on the bathroom floor
Moving hotel to hotel
Out on the road, no idea really what's in store

'Cause I knew I couldn't catch you
So I left the sky and I fell behind

We were one in the same
Running like moths to the flame
You'd hang on every word I'd say (word I'd say)
But now they only ricochet (ricochet)

We were falling away
You left me with a bittersweet taste
But when I send my heart your way (send my heart your way)
It bounces off the walls you made
Ricochet

If I was whole, I'd turn right now

Cries out, ""My God, they've killed them all!""

Here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

Three bodies lyin' there does Patty see
And another man named Bello, movin' around mysteriously
""I didn't do it,"" he says, and he throws up his hands
""I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand""

""I saw them leavin',"" he says, and he stops
""One of us had better call up the cops""
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene
With their red lights flashin' in the hot New Jersey night

Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down

When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that
In Paterson that's just the way things go
If you're black you might as well not show up on the street
'Less you wanna draw the heat

Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin' around
He said, ""I saw two men runnin' out, they looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates""

And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said, ""Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead""

But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head

Don't know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head

How do you feel? That is the question
But I forget, you don't expect an easy answer
When something like a soul becomes initialized
And folded up like paper dolls and little notes
You can't expect a bit of folks
So while you're outside looking in
Describing what you see
Remember what you're staring at is me

'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head

I can show you that
I can see right through
All your empty lies
I won't stay long
In this world so wrong

Say goodbye

Now your nightmare comes to life

Dragged you down below
Down to the devil's show
To be his guest forever
Peace of mind is less than never

Hate to twist your mind
But God ain't on your side
An old acquaintance severed
Burn the world your last endeavor

Flesh is burning, you can smell it in the air
'Cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal (steal)
So stand in line while they ink numbers in your head
You're now a slave until the end of time here
Nothing stops the madness turning, haunting, yearning
Pull the trigger

You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here

It's your fucking nightmare
While your nightmare comes to life

Can't wake up in sweat
Cause it ain't over yet
Still dancing with your demons

She taught me everything
Way down around Vicksburg
Around Louisiana way
Lived a Cajun lady, we called her Mississippi Queen

You know she was a dancer
She moved better on wine

Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change

An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change

The world is closing in
Did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers

The future's in the air
Can feel it everywhere
I'm blowing with the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment
